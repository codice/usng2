# How to contribute to USNG2
### Did you find a bug?
* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/codice/usng2/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/codice/usng2/issues/new).
Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an
**executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?
* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

### Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?
Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial
to the stability, functionality, or testability of USNG2 will generally
not be accepted.

### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?
* Suggest your change in the [usng2-developers group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/usng2-developers)
and start writing code.
* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive
feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug
reports and fixes.

### Do you have questions about the source code?
* Ask any question about how to use USNG2 in the [usng2-developers group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/usng2-developers)

Thanks!
